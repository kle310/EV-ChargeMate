# EV Charging Session Tracker

## Overview

LADWP offers free fast chargers with a 30-minute usage limit. However, the official app lacks the ability to display session durations, forcing users to physically check the charger's screen. To improve convenience, this app tracks and displays session durations in real time, allowing users to manage their charging sessions efficiently.

### Comparison

#### Official App  
- **Limitations**: No way to determine how long a charger has been in use or available.  
- **Screenshot**: *(e.g., Official app interface without duration details)*  

#### My App  
- **Enhanced Features**:  
  - Displays session duration for each charger.  
  - Shows the time a charger has been available since it became free.  

- **Examples**:  
  - **Charger in Use for 17 Minutes**:  
    *(Screenshot showing "Charger in use for 17 minutes")*  
  - **Charger Available for 3 Minutes**:  
    *(Screenshot showing "Charger available for 3 minutes")*
