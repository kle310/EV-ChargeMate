# EV Charging Session Tracker

## Overview

I developed this app as a fun project to learn new technologies, with the added benefit of promoting efficient use of government-subsidized chargers. The app provides real-time insights into charger availability, helping users plan their charging sessions effectively. Please note that Level 3 chargers have a 30-minute time limit, while Level 2 chargers are limited to 120 minutes.
